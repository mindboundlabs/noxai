# Nox AI  
**Understanding, Healing, and Transforming Emotions with AI**  

Nox AI is an innovative project that bridges the gap between emotional intelligence and artificial intelligence, providing tools for addressing, understanding, and transforming emotional pain points through creative mediums. This project introduces 129 meta-prompts, each designed to generate further AI-powered creative prompts for various forms of art and expression. These meta-prompts target specific emotional and psychological pain points and allow the generation of 20 prompts for each category, including AI art, songs, music, poems, stories, videos, short films, mini podcasts, and short comics.
